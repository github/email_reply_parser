I have gained valuable experience from working with students from other cultures. They bring a significantly different perspective to the work we do. I have also had the opportunity to practice making myself very clear in discussion, so that everyone understands. I've also seen how different our culture is to them, in their reactions to what I think is a normal approach to assignments, and to life in general.
