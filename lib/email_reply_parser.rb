# EmailReplyParser is a small library to parse plain text email content.  The
# goal is to identify which fragments are quoted, part of a signature, or
# original body content.  We want to support both top and bottom posters, so
# no simple "REPLY ABOVE HERE" content is used.
#
# Beyond RFC 5322 (which is handled by the [Ruby mail gem][mail]), there aren't
# any real standards for how emails are created.  This attempts to parse out
# common conventions for things like replies:
#
#     this is some text
#
#     On <date>, <author> wrote:
#     > blah blah
#     > blah blah
#
# ... and signatures:
#
#     this is some text
#
#     --
#     Bob
#     http://homepage.com/~bob
#
# Each of these are parsed into Fragment objects.
#
# EmailReplyParser also attempts to figure out which of these blocks should
# be hidden from users.
